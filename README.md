# SwiftUI-Projects
This repository consists of simple ios based apps that I created while following the course:https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui

1. WeSplit: A check-splitting app that one might use after eating at a restaurant – Enter the cost of your food, select how much of a tip you want to leave, and how many people you’re with, and it will tell you how much each person needs to pay.
